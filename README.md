This is a multi-threaded Rust implementation of the very cool book series "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" by Peter Shirley

Currently this is only the code for the first book, but I will be implementing the second book at some point.

Since I'm still fairly new to Rust there will be some weirdness in my code, but feel free to let me know if you spot anything that seems off.
